I just did manual code reading
I have seen unused imports are used in LlamaAbsoluteQuorum.sol & LlamaAbsolutePeerReview.sol
Its better to remove them for better readability of the code 
and i have seen some empty lines too
and in some instances we didn`t follow control structures as solidity style guide
refer here https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#control-structures 
and good to follow it

overall codebase is good but i didnt got much time for finding issues

### Time spent:
1 hours
