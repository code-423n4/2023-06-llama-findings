## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
During this audit, I found three high risks and one medium risk, which may result in DoS, assets lost, front-UI fraud, etc.

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
1. Manual review with VScode Solidity Metrics tell me which function is more complex so that I will pay more time on it.
2. Run `forge coverage` and `genhtml ...` to get an HTML source line-level coverage report. Then I wrote unit tests to improve the test and paid more time to the functions that were not tested before.

## Codebase quality analysis
The codebase is quite strong:
1. Test coverage is high (> 80%).
2. Many safe/robust functions are used (like SafeERC20).
3. Defensive code style.

But there are some warnings (search `warning` and `safety` keywords) to be solved, also they are not so severe to affect security. For example, LlamaCore just checks if the caller *currently* has permission instead of `block.number|timestamp - 1` for simpler and cheaper (no checkpoints), but introduced some race conditions. For another example, aggregate() in LlamaGovernanceScript can make arbitrary calls to be made within the context of `LlamaCore`. Wrote these warnings in docs may be better for users. 

## Centralization risks
I think there are two centralization risks:

1. The factory contract is controlled by Llama (sponsor) instance's executor, and the factory contract can control which accounts and strategies are authorized. Also, the factory controls the color and logo of instances in LLAMA_POLICY_METADATA_PARAM_REGISTRY. 
2. There are forceApprovalRole and forceDisapprovalRole in strategies, which introduce some centralization risks.
