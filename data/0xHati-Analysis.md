I started by reading the official scope and having a quick glance of the contracts. Extracting the lines per contract to have an overview of complexity. 
Started reading the most simple contracts to get a grasp and gradually dive into the other contracts as needed. The factory is the first contract where I delved deeper into as it's how instances are created. 
Any questions or things that were unclear I went back and read the docs. 

Later on, I tuned in on the twitter space to skim through it and find parts that might help me in my understanding.
It's great to have a professional team such as Llama which took the time to prepare the audit with their excellent docs and diagrams. It shows that if it's easier for people to understand the protocol they will more likely find bugs.
