## Approach taken
I first watched the short explainer video of the protocol to have a brief understanding of what it does and why
Then I dive straight to the contract before touching the full docs to get an understanding of the `HOW` it works in terms of the code implementation marking any potential issue in my inline note marks
After this, is when I really try to get a deep understanding of the seperate components and protocol as a whole by going through the docs and read any resource provided
then I go through my audit check list and verifying the inline note marks issue.

## What I learned
What I learned and also love about the Protocol is the rich and well documented natSpec in every code

## comments for the judge
