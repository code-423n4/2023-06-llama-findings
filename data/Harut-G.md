Hello, I find that LlamaAccount contract derived from ILlamaAccount interface (there are also many contracts which are derived from its interfaces). I know that it is done for dependency injection but in blockchain it is not common practice. It will add additional bytecode and gas usage to contracts. Additional bytecode will bring expensive deployment. The main reason of interface usage is external calls.
