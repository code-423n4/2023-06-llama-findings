2023-06-llama Analysis Report

## Approach
At this point in my web3 security auditing journey, I am primarily focused on the bot races. Due to time constraints, particularly for these shorter duration audits with a relatively large SLOC, I am not always able to take a deep dive into the protocol. I was only able to dedicate about five hours to this audit. I used my bot to produce a report and then spent time validating the findings, removing false positives, and removing findings already covered in the Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues.

## Learnings
My learnings for this audit were primarily related to improving my bot. Some of the rules I've defined are finding too many false positives and thus requiring too much time to weed those out of the final report. I also learned that many of my rules are working as desired since they produced results that matched the winning bot report.

## Goals
My goals are (1) to continue to improve my bot such that it produces a high quality report that covers the low hanging issues so that I can (2) spend my time doing a deeper dive into the code base and uncover higher severity vulnerabilities that can help the protocol avoid post-deployment security issues.

Thank you for the opportunities provided by Code4rena!
