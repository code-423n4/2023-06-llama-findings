## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- First of all, I go through the code quickly in about 1 hour.
- Then I start reading all kinds of documentation related to Llama.
- Then I read the code more carefully and put notes in certain places.
- After I have passed for the second time, I read the audit made by Spearbit
- Now that I've gotten a fuller picture of what Llama is all about, I went through the code one last time and stopped to write a report where I left notes.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

With every new project, I learn something new. When I start to write a report, I go deeper into the specific thing.
Specifically in this report, I learned more about `signature` functions.

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

I don't have any specific comments. Everything I should have written in the report.
