# Approach
My first perception of involving in the Llama audit was finding fewer issues as itâ€™s already audited by SpearbitDao that is consider the expert platform in Web3 security.
Looking at the documents also create more confusion due to my beginner level, but the 4.33 minutes video explainer improve my knowledge on how the protocol work from different contract interacting with each other like llamacore and llamapolicy.
Afterwards, I started looking from bottom to find optimisation areas with also searching for vulnerabilities on how contract carry out its operation.
# Learning
I learned that it is better to understand every project working as each project is unique and does not follow the universal rule of following a specific code rule.
# Comments
The video explainer helps in understanding the illustration and going through documents. Later i go through the codebase and able to find several issues at low and a single one in medium category with totally spending around 12 hours.
